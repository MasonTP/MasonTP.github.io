    <h1>Muffins, the early years</h1>
    <p>Hi. My name is muffins. I am a mighty cat. I was adopted by my family when I was only three weeks old.</p>
    <p>My new mommy is a human. They are funny creatures</p>
    <p> I left the pound with my new mommy and new sister, Maria. They took me straight to the pet store to buy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
        <li>A small cloth toy</li>
        <li>Litter box with litter</li>
        <li>Food (for later)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mom and sis had to feed me by the bottle because I was so young.</p>
